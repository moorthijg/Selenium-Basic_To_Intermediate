what is gherkins in cucumber?
Gherkins is simple language which is used to interpret and execute the test scripts.
interesting fact about Gherkin is, it supports not only English but many other native languages such as
French, Finnish, Indonesian, Hungarian,Tamil , Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati..

How it actually works?
Example we have Social media web application and consider the following test scenarios:

Gherkin uses  keywords :
Given --> Social media app user
When --> if he gives valid username and password
And ---> it should allow the user to login to their account
Then --> the user can see their account/feed.

A Feature can be defined as a standalone unit or functionality of a project.
Let us assume the functionalities of the Social media ,

1.create and restricting the user from the site.
2.post a picture/video of theirs and others.
3.can sending the friend request to anyone.
4.Login
5.logout

Each functionality of the application is also called as a feature.

Feature == Functionality

A feature contains some list of scenarios to be tested.
Example:
The login functionality(Feature) of the social media ,
-> valid username and valid password can allow the user to login
->valid username and invalid password don't allow the user to login
-> when logged in successfully user can be able to see the newsfeed / their account.


Feature Files
The file, in which Cucumber tests are written, is known as feature files. It is advisable that there should be a separate feature file,
for each feature under test. The extension of the feature file needs to be “.feature”.
One can create as many feature files as needed. To have an organized structure, each feature should have one feature file.
