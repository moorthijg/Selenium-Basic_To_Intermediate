What is waits in selenium?

Waits help the user to troubleshoot issues while re-directing to different web pages.
waits are used to resolve "ElementNotVisibleException" which means the desired element
is not present in the current webpage.

There are three types of waits available in the selenium
i.implict wait
2.explict wait
3.fluent waits

1.implict wait --> this wait is applied entirely to the starting to closing of webdriver instance and
applied  to all the elements which is present in the current webpage.

2.explict wait --> this wait is applied to the particular webelement in the webpage and it contains only
until method.

3.fluent wait --> fluent wait is not a normal wait it is applied to the dynamic webelements present in the
webpage and this wait checks the webelement for frequent time intervals.
