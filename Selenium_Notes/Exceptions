Exception  as the word indicates, is a special or uncommon case.

The piece of code which might throw an exception is added inside the Try block.

#2) The Catch statement catches the exception and takes it as a parameter.

#3) When no exception is thrown, the try statement is executed and not the catch statement.

There are three kinds of exceptions:

1.Checked Exception --> Checked exception is handled during compile time
2.Unchecked Exception --> The compiler ignores during compile time
3.Error  --> Array_Index_out_OfBoundException


try-catch blocks are generally used to handle exceptions. Type of exceptions is declared in catch block which is expected to come.
throws keyword in java is used to throw an exception rather than handling it. All checked exceptions can be thrown by methods.
initially, block executes irrespective of execution of try-catch block and it executes immediately.
Throwable: Throwable is a parent class for error and exception. Generally, it is difficult to handle errors in java.
