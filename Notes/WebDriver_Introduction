                                WebDriver

WebDriver is a important component of the selenium which is used to interact directly with browsers
and test scripts.

Architecture of the WebDriver -->

SelectContext--> WebDriver --> RemoteWebDriver --> ChromeDriver, firefoxdriver ,EdgeDriver, HtmlUnitDriver

here,
SelectContext --> super interface of WebDriver
WebDriver --> child Interface of selectContext
RemoteWebDriver --> class which implements WebDriver interface
ChromeDriver, firefoxdriver ,EdgeDriver, HtmlUnitDriver --> These are the sub-classes of RemoteWebDriver
which implements WebDriver interface.

some questions?

why we can't write below code?
WebDriver driver = new WebDriver();
we can't create object for an interface which means it doesn't have any values inside it and it
returns only null values.
but ,
ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(): can able to create but we didn't prefer this too
even if this is correct why?

while testing the application we need to run the scripts on almost all the browsers so we need to
write scripts again again for another browsers that's why we didn't prefer this method even though it's
right.

WebDriver driver = new Chromedriver(); explain this

we create object (driver) for a class Chromedriver by taking WebDDriver as reference of an interface,
by using this we can implement all methods of interface (webdriver) in chromeDriver() class.

WebDriver --> contains only methods which doesn't have definitions
but RemoteDriver --> implements those methods with definitions.
