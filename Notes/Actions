Action is another interface we uses in selenium

we use in selenium to perform keyboard actions and mouse actions
like right click , double click , pressing enter , switching tabs , selecting all the contents in the
web page.

As we know that we cant implement action interface directly we use Actions class for implementing
Action interface.

here we use perform and build keyword which is used to perform actions
the difference between build and perform is ,
build --> it organises all the actions together and perform used to execute the actions altogether.
perform --> it doesn't wait for other actions once the perform is given it executed as soon as possible.
