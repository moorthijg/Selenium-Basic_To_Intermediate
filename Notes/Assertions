Assert :
Assert is used for verifying the critical functionalities of the applications which means if the test script fails it doesn't make sense
to test other methods.
Hence, the test method is aborted as soon as failure occurs.

Verify:
SoftAssert class should be imported to execute the verify results and
this method is directly opposite to the Assert which means if any one test is failed in the script it still executes the other cases which means
 this action can be used for regression testing.
